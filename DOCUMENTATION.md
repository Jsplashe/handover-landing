## Introduction

HANDOVER is a blockchain-backed productivity platform designed for clean, trustworthy transitions of work ownership across teams and time zones. This document provides comprehensive information about the platform's features, architecture, and implementation.

## User Roles

HANDOVER supports multiple user roles, each with specific permissions and capabilities:

### Freelancers / Contractors
- Create and send handovers to clients
- Track time spent on projects
- Maintain a verifiable record of completed work

### Project Managers
- Oversee multiple handovers across teams
- Approve or reject handovers
- Generate reports on team productivity

### Team Members
- Participate in internal handovers
- Track progress on assigned tasks
- Collaborate on shared projects

### Administrators
- Manage user accounts and permissions
- Configure organization-wide settings
- Access audit logs and system reports

## Core Features

### Handover Creation
Users can create new handovers by specifying:
- Project details
- Recipient information
- Summary of work completed
- Attached files and documentation
- Time logged

### Blockchain Verification
Each handover is recorded on the blockchain, providing:
- Immutable proof of work completion
- Cryptographically secure timestamps
- Verifiable chain of custody

### AI-Powered Forecasting
The platform uses AI to:
- Predict completion times for similar handovers
- Identify potential bottlenecks in workflows
- Suggest optimizations for handover processes

### Eco-Conscious Features
HANDOVER includes features to reduce digital carbon footprint:
- Carbon Lite Mode to minimize server requests
- Digital Carbon Tracker to monitor emissions
- Integration with carbon offset programs

## Blockchain Integration

### Supported Networks
- Ethereum
- Polygon
- Optimism
- Arbitrum

### Smart Contract Architecture
HANDOVER uses a series of smart contracts to:
- Record handover metadata on-chain
- Verify the authenticity of handovers
- Enable trustless dispute resolution

### Wallet Integration
Users can connect their Web3 wallets to:
- Sign handover transactions
- Verify their identity on-chain
- Access their complete handover history

## Eco-Conscious Design

### Carbon Footprint Reduction
HANDOVER implements several strategies to reduce carbon emissions:
- Optimized API calls to minimize server load
- Efficient data storage and retrieval
- Reduced client-side processing

### Carbon Tracking
The platform provides detailed metrics on:
- Carbon emissions per handover
- Team-wide environmental impact
- Comparison with industry averages

### Offset Programs
Users can opt into carbon offset programs to:
- Neutralize their digital carbon footprint
- Support environmental initiatives
- Receive eco-certification for their projects
